Tesla HK just swap battery packs in such cases (to save time for owner).    Sorry, no number for ideal range following a range mode charge, as I don't range mode charge.

They installed a battery with about 8K on it, so my battery mileage is ~14K less than my odometer.  The PEM failure was an infant mortality thing, and they drove out to my office and replaced the PEM on site, so it was running within hours.  I guessed the date and mileage for both the PEM and battery replacemenmt (though the battery mileage is pretty close, since it was at the 24K service).

It started working again but during the next service they exchanged it for a reconditioned PEM under warrantee.  At 43,000 miles there was a fault on charging with the DC/DC converter located in the battery pack.  They switched the pack for a reconditioned one.  The most recent problem was a short in the drive for the cooling fans that caused fuses to blow in the PEM and battery pack. They switched both PEM and the battery pac

At home  240v 32a.  I don't charge at home unless I've been driving a lot.  At 117v 15A standard charge finishes @ 185mi, but over the next couple hours it drifts up to 191mi usually.  I don't see that upwards drift with 240v charging.  I suspect that the slow 110v charge lets weak cells get more charge (because they're slow) and then the upward drift is from stronger cells giving up Ah to the slower cells.

I am 99% sure it was the rear wiring harness that was at fault and it was replaced at the same time.  Since I am 300 miles from a service center they swapped it all.  So I am not sure it is fair to say I had a bad PEM but it is possible.

Battery drops from 99% to 94% @ 1/2 hour after range charge finishes.  PEM filter I have installed (last year after latest blower upgrade) effectively prevents (mostly oak leaves) debris from getting into the PEM cooling blower. I no longer have PEM temperature issues at all (so far).

I was generally charging at 240V/40A. Then I moved closer to my job and only have 120V available. Then for about 1 year I was charging in standard every day and the range never dropped below 120 miles. Recently (2 months) I have been letting the range drop much lower and typically charge to 60-80 miles unless I know I have a long trip. (after talking to MPT).

Love the car, though I do find it &quot;needy&quot;.  It's never left me stranded, but a number of small things needed to be taken care of, some of which were an unintentional &quot;gift&quot; from the prior owner.  This is my first electric car, and I find that managing the battery charging is something one needs to inject in their daily routine, but that's an ok tradeoff.

It was 201.5 miles with 8% and 18 ideal miles remaining, and cranky warnings from the car about how uncertain the energy estimate is at that low SOC.

I question how accurate these readings are since I still have never done a range charge or gone below 50% S.O.C. But I am pretty certain there has been minimal if any degradation to the battery over the last year, even though I have driven more this year than previous years.
